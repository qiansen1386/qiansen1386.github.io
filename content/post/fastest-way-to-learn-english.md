若你想听懂英语，从而更流畅地说，更快速地回应别人。那么，我必须地隆重地安利你尝试下最佳方法——“**学舌与同步跟读法（Parrot and Overshadow Method）**”

If you want to be able to hear and understand English that is spoken quickly and be able to respond quickly, then I would say the best way is to try the "**Parrot and Overshadow Method.**"

践行此法，尔等需口头重复你所听到的一切，尝试让你的发音尽可能地贴近原始声线。第一步是鹦鹉学舌（听完重复）。第二步是跟读（同步跟读）。这个方法必须要你确确实实地<big>大声</big>读出来，才有效。

In this method, you orally repeat everything that you hear, trying to sound just like the original speaker. First, you parrot (repeat) them. Then, you overshadow (speak at the same time) them. This method only works if you actually speak OUT LOUD.

学舌最好配合纯正的（由真正的英文母语者编就的）且伴随有音频且内置字幕或台词脚本的英语材料。如：电影，电视节目（剧），广播，新闻网站，等等。只要他有音频加字幕或台本就行（最好内容别太长）。

Parroting is best used with authentic English material (materials created by actual native speakers) with an audio component and subtitles or a script included. Movies, TV shows, podcasts, news websites, etc. As long as it has audio and a subtitle/script (and it's not too long), you can use it.

介绍下机理：

This is how it works:

选取你的教材，最好别太长（500单词以内）。闭上眼睛只听音频，尽你最大可能，能听懂多少算多少。接下来，读一下字幕或脚本。找一找不认识的单词和短语，查查词典，记住他们。

Choose your material. It shouldn't be too long (maximum of 500 words).
Close your eyes and just listen to the audio, trying to understand as much as possible.
Then, read the subtitles or script. Find words and phrases you don't know, look them up in a dictionary, and take note of them.

再接下来重复听音频，每句话之后暂停一下。重复演员说完的句子（学舌的部分）。重复多次，直到你可以熟练掌握。最后重复一遍，这次你与音频中的演员同时出声（同步跟读的部分）。这可能很难，所以你若有需要，可以重复多试几遍。最后的最后，回顾一下你所学的单词，当日的生词和词组可以放入单词本或手写卡里，一遍之后定期回顾。一天的工作就做完了。

Then, replay the audio, pausing the audio after each sentence. Repeat after the speaker (parroting). Repeat many times until you get good at this.
Repeat the audio one last time, this time speaking at the same time as the speaker (overshadowing). This may be tough, so you can repeat this if you need to.
Review the learned words one last time. The new words and phrases from today can be put into flashcards that you review regularly. You are done for the day.
