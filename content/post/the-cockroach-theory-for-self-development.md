> At a restaurant, a cockroach suddenly flew from somewhere and sat on a lady.
>
> She started screaming out of fear.
  With a panic stricken face and trembling voice,she started jumping, with both her hands desperately trying to get rid of the cockroach.
  Her reaction was contagious, as everyone in her group also got panicky.
  The lady finally managed to push the cockroach away but ...it landed on another lady in the group.
  Now, it was the turn of the other lady in the group to continue the drama.
  The waiter rushed forward to their rescue.
  In the relay of throwing, the cockroach next fell upon the waiter.
  The waiter stood firm, composed himself and observed the behavior of the cockroach on his shirt.
  When he was confident enough, he grabbed it with his fingers and threw it out of the restaurant.
  Sipping my coffee and watching the amusement, the antenna of my mind picked up a few thoughts and started wondering, was the cockroach 
  responsible for their histrionic behavior?
  If so, then why was the waiter not disturbed?
  He handled it near to perfection, without any chaos.
  It is not the cockroach, but the inability of the ladies to handle the disturbance caused by the cockroach that disturbed the ladies.
  I realized that, it is not the shouting of my father or my boss or my wife that disturbs me, but it's my inability to handle the disturbances caused by their shouting that disturbs me.
  It's not the traffic jams on the road that disturbs me, but my inability to handle the disturbance caused by the traffic jam that disturbs me.
  More than the problem, it's my reaction to the problem that creates chaos in my life.
  Lessons learnt from the story:
  I understood, I should not react in life.
  I should always respond.
  The women reacted, whereas the waiter responded.
> Reactions are always instinctive whereas responses are always well thought of.
> 
> A beautiful way to understand............LIFE.

~~很久很久以前，距离中土大唐十万八千里的恒河平原上，有一间小餐馆~~餐馆里不知哪里飞来的一只蟑螂落在了某位女士身上。
这货当时吓尿了！10万分贝，瞬间爆炸！
惊惶欲绝<sup>1</sup>的她的脸，颤抖中的声线；双手狂挥，旋转跳跃，她闭着眼；摆脱这~~可爱的~~小强的企图，却无法实现。她的反应影响了周边所有的人<sup>2</sup>，她的同伴都开始惊慌起来。这货最后终于摆脱了小强~~估计是小强海盗船玩儿腻了233~~然而……他却飞到了同组另外一枚妹纸身上。这下马上就要轮到这另一个美女重复刚才的闹剧的节骨眼，只见得这边厢餐厅服务员冲向前来解救他们了。说时迟那时快，转眼之间小强又梯云纵到服务员的身上。这服务员双脚站定，气定神闲地观察起衬衫上小强下一步的出招。当他觉得大局已定时，他用手指一把抓过小强，把它丢出了餐厅。

我在一旁悠闲地嘬<sup>3</sup>着~~茶~~咖啡看着戏<sup>4</sup>，此时我的脑洞里<sup>5</sup>闪过几道流星。我就突然想，蟑螂真的他们这精彩表现的原因么？

注解：
<sup>1</sup>：Panic=>惊慌，stricken => 受挫折的；受…侵袭的；连起来（panic-stricken）叫做惊恐万状，此处译为惊惶欲绝，我给满分。
<sup>2</sup>: Contagious adj. 感染性的；会蔓延的
<sup>3</sup>: Sipping  <动名词>小口抿，啜饮
<sup>4</sup>: amusement 娱乐（真的是消遣的意思）
<sup>5</sup>：antenna 天线 => the antenna of my mind 姑且翻译为脑洞吧，各位亲见谅，这儿没法直译吧。
