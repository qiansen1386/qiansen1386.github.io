- [Typora](https://www.typora.io/): Minimal, Math block and **WYSIWYG**
- [Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/): Bueatiful, powerful, **extremely-extensible** and split-windows

Both are well-designed, support complete markdown syntax with extras.
So they both add in a little bit of non-standard syntax, which may not work in other renders. Love it or hate it, it's up to u. I â™¥ them, both, a lot.
