Recently, I have migrated to Hugo Site generator as you can see. I was pretty disappointed with most of the theme.
Even those great themes seem to have flaws, or require customization. And then I thought, if none of the theme is perfect
for me, why not craft one by my own. Since I always been fascinated by the frontend development, I take it as a 
oppertunaty to bring my frontend skill sets to another level.

So I created the stupid [hugo-elf-theme](github.com/qiansen1386/hugo-elf-theme). I have got to say, the name is pretty arbitrary.
Even worse, I don't have a clue even after I started. I start to realised that I need to have more input before I make an output.
Hence, I started my long-term(supposed to be) voyage. Here are the resources that absolutely worth more attention.
