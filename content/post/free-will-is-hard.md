Somebody developed a sophisticated way of  humiliating people, discouraging people, depressing people, in order to ultimately manipulate them by enforcing and utilizing their diffidence. Those who do are usually incompetent, but whom they controlled are usually outstanding. F**k! 

Free will is what I advocate, thus stockholm syndrome is what I hated the most. For parrents of those lost generation, If u are not willing to nourish ur children with love don't give birth to them at the first place. As a human, I am begging u to derive power from ur deep heart and learn to be your own master. 

**Remember life might be tough but always fair.**
